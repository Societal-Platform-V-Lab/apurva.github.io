        Ever since my first few conversations with Anand Rajan, our Mission
        Leader, he has constantly highlighted the importance of community voices
        and how best we can bring it to the front with Apurva.ai. During one
        such conversation, he said “we must move systems with narratives, and
        not only statistics”. Having always sought out narratives to learn and
        explore, this resonated deeply with me.

        “systems change aims to bring about lasting change by altering
        underlying structures and supporting mechanisms which make the system
        operate in a particular way. These can include policies, routines,
        relationships, resources, power structures and values.”
      </p>
      <p>
        When we look at problems or solutions as part of a larger,
        interconnected system, we can trace the relationship between these
        parts, where changes in one area can affect other parts, leading to
        unintended consequences. A panoramic view is essential here, where
        alongside numbers and charts, narratives offer a layer of understanding
        through emotions and experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Narratives as an approach</strong>
        Narratives have always been a safe space to understand for me, from my
        grandparents’ narrating myths to opting for case-study based
        assignments. It is shaped by the coming together of similar stories that
        convey collective themes and messages. Rooted in human experience, an
        authentic source of wisdom, narratives offer insights on the hows and
        whys of events.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most enticing aspect of narratives is our ability to process
        information and create meanings out of patterns from it. As they are an
        integral part of our childhood, across cultures and geographies,
        narratives encourage us to recognise problems, one’s journey of facing
        it and the solution at the end of the tunnel. This is called
        <a

          >narrative intelligence</a
        >
        and makes problem solving more effective. The narrator has the choice to
        decide what and how much to share, bringing in their personal views. The
        diversity in perspectives helps us to view the same problems and
        solutions from different lenses. This encourages listeners to not just
        hear but connect to different views, experiences and emotions.

          How does Apurva.ai enable moving systems with narratives?</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        The most prominent manifestation of narratives changing systems is
        witnessed through Apurva’s building block,
        <a class="underline" href="https://apurva.ai/Voice-Communities.html"
          >Voice of Communities.</a
        >
        With community voices as stories at the centre, they shape narratives
        that talk beyond problems and solutions, delving into difficulties,
        priorities and successes. Every narrative is unique, adding to the
        overall understanding. It also enables one to zoom in and out to gain
        out of the box perspectives from different stakeholders.
      </p>
      <p>
        With Voice of Communities,<br />
        ● Communities are placed at the centre, thereby bringing their voices to
        the table of decision makers. <br />
        ● Shift in focus to understanding the needs of communities.<br />
        ● Adaptation of diverse localised solutions for solving global problems
        with one’s local resources, cultures and problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of my favourite aspects of Voice of Communities is the ability to
        listen to the actual voice and make our own interpretations. Backed by
        our own socio-cultural background and understanding of the world,
        diverse interpretations lead to more insights from the same story,
        making it open-ended.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Apurva.ai, narratives are catalysts for meaningful change. By
        amplifying narrative through community voices, we strive to move systems
        in ways that statistics alone cannot.
