        <p>The development sector works to improve the well-being and quality of life of communities, promotes
            environmental sustainability and fosters public policy and advocacy. The process of development follows the
            lives of people, their problems and designing solutions for these complex problems. Coming from a
            development background, I recognise the importance of discussions and dialogues in the sector as the
            preliminary phases of solving problems greatly involve a deep dive into understanding the problem through a
            series of discussions and consultations. These interactions could be with any stakeholders of the society -
            community, institutions or government. However, never did I imagine that a technology like AI could be an
            integral part of these human conversations and hold the capability to reimagine the process of development. 
        </p>
        <p>

            I recall the day I witnessed Apurva’s ‘Power of Co-creation’ for the first time in a live conversation and I
            was amazed at its capability of being an equally active participant in the conversation. Based on the
            ongoing discussion, Apurva emerged with insights and perspectives during the conversation, many of which
            even the participants of the conversation could not think of (Fig 1). Not only were the insights and
            perspectives useful to deep dive into the conversation, but the questions emerging alongside the
            conversation were thought-provoking guiding further deep thinking. The outcome of the entire conversation,
            packaged along with ‘out of the box’ thinking and deep diving into problems and scenarios made me realise
            how unique Apurva was. It was indeed an ‘AHA moment’ for me to imagine Apurva being a part of such
            conversations in the development sector and leveraging the wisdom to solve problems.

        <p>
            My AHA moments were also shared by many others in our network. Talking about this, Rachita Misra, Associate
            Director, Knowledge and Advocacy, SELCO Foundation, explained how Apurva sits as an equal participant during
            co-creation by offering insights and perspectives that are sometimes not thought of even by the participants
            present in the conversations. These insights and perspectives promptly lead to important points that
            participants can further ponder on, in understanding the problem better. She shared how Apurva’s Power of
            Co-creation has been helping their organisation to deep dive into understanding the problem thereby easing
            the process of designing for solving.

        <p>
            The beauty and importance of co-creation will be better recognised by knowledge curators and heads of
            organisations. By co-creating, one could leverage the various pieces of knowledge that emerge from
            collaborations and conversations, leading to learnings across different departments, stakeholders and
            networks. This not only aids in guiding designing programs, modifying workflows and decision making but it
            also holds the potential to positively impact the organisation's work and implementations in the long run.

        <p>
            Approaches to development mostly rely on knowledge sharing, discussions, interactions, workshops and many
            more forms of communication. While the discussions and conversations in various departments and various
            domains continuously happen, it is extremely crucial to deep dive into the content and context of these
            discussions so as to minimise the reinvention of the wheel around the complex problems. An organisation can
            link the dots by zooming in and out of conversations within the organisation. This will promote
            cross-learning and reduce the learning curve at numerous ends. Looking at the various emerging themes within
            and outside one’s network, it can help an organisation to prioritise their work areas, the problems that
            need to be prioritised and focus on collaborations for interventions with their networks. So many
            interesting opportunities that can be explored under the umbrella of Apurva’s Power of Co-creation. </p>

        <p>
            It is inspiring to witness how simple conversations in passionate organisations like SELCO Foundation,
            ProjectECHO and Catalysts Group can be a game changer when leveraged with co-creation and collective wisdom
            across departments, geographies and networks!
