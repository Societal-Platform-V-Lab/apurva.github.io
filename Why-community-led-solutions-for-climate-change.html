          <strong>Why community-led solutions for climate change?</strong>
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Have you come across stories of Indian communities painting their roofs
        white to mitigate urban heat, Bangladeshi farmers living on the coast
        experimenting with salt tolerant varieties of crops and communities in
        Peru reviving traditional systems of storing water? 
      </p>
      <p>
        These are very inspiring tales of communities coming together to tackle
        climate change. Local communities are at the frontline of being
        impacted, where their response aids in reducing climate risk, and to
        also build their own resilience. Localisation of solutions, innovations
        and actions is thus highly encouraged so empowered communities can work
        towards reducing vulnerability from climate change. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Encouraging local communities to participate in tackling climate change
        can be done through many ways, like raising awareness, access to
        nature-based solutions and facilitating local adaptation. These can help
        to build safety nets for communities, offering them a chance to be
        prepared against the impacts of climate change.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          Why are community-led solutions important in climate change?
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Being able to assess context-specific problems, opportunities and
        resources, local communities are placed at the heart of designing and
        adopting solutions relevant for them. Local solutions offer the
        essential layer of adding depth and durability of solutions to tackle
        climate problems. When looking at climate change, its problems and
        potential solutions, the involvement of various stakeholders, including
        the on-ground experience of communities, offers diverse perspectives of
        understanding the problem. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, it is important for communities to participate in decision making
        and implementation of climate solutions. They are the representation of
        what’s happening on the ground and how it impacts them. Let’s take the
        examples mentioned above.

                small, circular pits, sow seeds and fill it with organic matter.
                During rains, the water releases nutrients that attract insects
                that dig galleries for water to infiltrate. Thus, a small hole
                becomes fertile pockets for growing crops.

        With more communities being vocal, it enables one to look at problems
        from the lens of community needs, challenges and innovations. Thus, a
        community-centric approach enhances community engagement and
        participation on one hand. On the other hand, it helps organisations to
        prioritise community needs with contextual data. This leads to building
        the capacity of communities. This is what we witness in Apurva.ai’s
        Voice of Communities.
      </p>
      <p><strong> How else can we enhance community-led solutions?</strong></p>
      <p>
        This is an essential question to ask when tackling such an extensive yet
        urgent problem like climate change, where we are running out of time and
        we need all hands on deck. With the urgency required to tackle climate
        change, there is not much time to experiment and reinvent the wheel.
      </p>
      <p>
        With Apurva.ai’s Voice of Communities, community-led solutions can be
        brought together and leveraged by the communities themselves. They can
        learn relevant and effective interventions from peers tackling similar
        problems. This exposes them to diverse innovations and perspectives,
        from various cultural and regional backgrounds. Here, by adding a layer
        of curated community-led solutions and sharing them back to communities,
        we can reimagine the very approach of tackling climate change. One that
        leads to empowering communities, building resilience to tackle problems
        as well as to learn from the virtual network of their peers.
