          <strong>Accessibility: The Desired Design </strong>
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Accessibility is the protagonist who has the ability to break down
        barriers across various avenues like resources, opportunities and
        information. And most importantly, it stands out as the desired design
        for any route.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Accessibility</strong> offers equal opportunities for inclusive
        participation and engagement, regardless of individual differences or
        the circumstances. It aims to create an inclusive and equitable space
        where everyone can participate and contribute. As listed above, there
        are various barriers to accessibility. These can be categorised into
        four main types: physical, digital, information, and social. 
      </p>

      <div class="center">
        <img src="source/img/1 1900262675.png" alt="Centered Image" />
      </div>
      <br />

      <p>
        Accessibility is built on the concept of inclusion and equity, where the
        focus is not only about equal opportunities and access, but also on
        meeting the different requirements of different people. Implementing
        accessibility relies on identifying and responding to the ability of
        people from different walks of life to access needs, opportunities and
        goals across various circumstances. The equitable solutions for
        accessibility designed have to balance inclusion of population and at
        the same time uphold privacy, independence and integrity for everyone.
      </p>

      <p>
        Research says that the most suitable solution would be to identify the
        problem in terms of accessibility and remove it rather than provide
        means to overcome the problem. This is called the liberation stage. For
        instance, with growing digital platforms and increasing use of
        technology opens up the world for people with disabilities. Capabilities
        like translating text to speech, speech to text and even simple video
        calls have made it possible to break barriers of communication. This
        reminds me of my friend’s excitement to witness a couple who were deaf
        having a quick chat on video call with sign language!
      </p>
      <p>
        Let us take a look at digital accessibility during the pandemic. Since
        the world was locked down and there was a sudden jump to digital
        platforms for various things, it negatively affected the people who
        lacked digital skills and digital infrastructure resulting in digital
        vulnerability. Thus, many were isolated and cut off from the world,
        losing opportunities and spaces of employment, health, information and
        networking. Reimagine if the design had considered the large population
        of digitally illiterate people, especially for booking slots for
        vaccines, with spaces where people who don’t have access can be helped
        by others. Or multiple options could have been offered for vaccine
        slots.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>The desired design</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        It is a welcoming space for all which changes the so-called normal and
        also creates new standards of inclusion. The combination of
        accessibility and inclusive space translates into values, processes and
        training, finally encouraging embracing differences in people.
        Accessibility leads to:
      </p>
      <div class="dis">
        <ul>
          <li>More independence and participation </li>
          <li>Diversity of perspectives </li>
          <li>Social cohesion and harmony</li>
          <li>Resilience and adaptability of society</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p>
        Working towards accessibility, one has to steer towards empowering
        people by designing for diversity across populations, age and culture. A
        multi-dimensional approach and involving different actors helps in
        designing for accessibility, where the solutions can be customised and
        localised easily across infrastructures, working processes and norms.
        Just like how technology is helping to bridge communication routes
        amongst people with disabilities, people from different linguistic
        backgrounds, where it can be customised, localised and translated into
        different preferred mediums.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong> Big picture for accessibility </strong>
      </p>
      <div class="center">
        <img src="source/img/1 1900262676.png" alt="Centered Image" />
      </div>
      <br />
      <p>
        The workings of <strong> Apurva.ai,</strong> founded on collective
        wisdom, aims to offer an inclusive accessible space. Rachna KG, Growth
        Lead, says that one of the bare minimum requirements for inclusiveness
        is accessibility. She elaborates that considering the diverse needs of
        the population, Apurva is designed to be accessible across different
        languages, various modes (like text, audio and videos) and multiple
        channels (like web, whatsapp, interactive voice response (IVR) and call
        centres). 
      </p>
      <p>
        Incorporating as part of the default design, accessibility, as the
        protagonist, opens doors to access information, activities and
        environments in a sensible, meaningful and usable way by a diverse range
        of people. This, we believe, opens up the world to more people, knitting
        a tight, inclusive space for all to share, participate and grow in. What
        is your route for accessibility as the desired design?
