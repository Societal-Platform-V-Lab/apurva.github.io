            </p>
        </div>

        <p>The development sector works to improve the well-being and quality of life of communities, promotes
            environmental sustainability and fosters public policy and advocacy. The process of development follows the
            lives of people, their problems and designing solutions for these complex problems. Coming from a
            development background, I recognise the importance of discussions and dialogues in the sector as the
            preliminary phases of solving problems greatly involve a deep dive into understanding the problem through a
            series of discussions and consultations. These interactions could be with any stakeholders of the society -
            community, institutions or government. However, never did I imagine that a technology like AI could be an
            integral part of these human conversations and hold the capability to reimagine the process of development.

            <strong> Health literacy and information overload</strong><br>
            An individual's ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services in order to
            make informed decisions about their health is defined as <strong> health literacy</strong>. It includes a
            wide range of skills
            and awareness to navigate healthcare systems, understand medical terminology, and interpret health
            information. It is very essential to enable people to understand their medical conditions, engage with
            healthcare providers and make informed decisions about their health.
        </p>

        <p><strong> Health information overload</strong>, on the other hand, is an excessive amount of information
            individuals are exposed
            to. This can overwhelm individuals and make it difficult to understand and make decisions for their health.
            There has been a steep rise in health information overload with increasing usage of internet and digital
            technologies, making it easy to access health information from different sources, with varying degrees of
            accuracy and credibility. Many times, a simple online search can lead down a rabbit hole of contradictory
            information, leading to confusion, stress and inability to make informed decisions.
        </p>
        <div class="center d-sm-block d-md-none">
            <img src="source/img/1 1900262670.png" alt="Centered Image">
        </div><br>
        <p>
            The fine line between poor health literacy and unauthenticated health information overload can contribute to
            health anxiety, where anxious individuals are not only impacted psychologically on an individual level but
            also contribute to spreading health rumours. The spreading of incorrect information results in dangerous and
            negative consequences. When tracing the relationship between reducing health information overload and
            improving health literacy, we can observe that trusted, credible information and sources can enhance this. 

        </p>
        <p>
            Trusted sources are those that meet the criteria of credibility, clarity and transparency.

        </p>
        <div class="center">
            <img src="source/img/3 2.png" alt="Centered Image">

        <p>
            Information from healthcare professionals, health organisations, government, academic and research
            institutes, and regulatory bodies are well regarded and trusted for health. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong> Trusted sources in health</strong><br>
            Trusted health information, when made easy to access, understand, apply and appraise for informed decision
            making, improves health literacy. Health information can be filled with jargon and tough to understand. So,
            how can health information be accurate, relevant and understandable?

        </p>

        <p>
            Different stakeholders in healthcare can also play a role in promoting trusted information to improve health
            literacy. Medical practitioners have the responsibility to ensure information on health is communicated
            clearly and effectively. Offering trusted and credible information, they need to tailor it to the patient's
            specific needs. This can be done by using simple language, visual aids and different communication
            techniques. Information can be easier to grasp with varied and interesting representations like graphs,
            infographics, case studies and stories, grounded in local and cultural context.
        </p>
        <p>
            Patients have to actively seek out trusted sources to access and understand health information. This way,
            they are informed, updated, course correct when required and participate in their healthcare. 

        <p>
            It is inspiring to witness how simple conversations in passionate organisations like SELCO Foundation,
            ProjectECHO and Catalysts Group can be a game changer when leveraged with co-creation and collective wisdom
            across departments, geographies and networks! 

        </p>
        <p>

            Systematic reviews by researchers and policy advocates is grounded in conducting rigorous research,
            analysing evidence on various health topics to provide evidence-based recommendations. They can not only
            guide patients and practitioners to trusted health information, but also identify and address research gaps
            in healthcare.
        </p>
        <p>
            Well curated information from trusted sources can help to build a trusted repository on healthcare. It can
            be used as the foundation to raise awareness and provide interventions, specifically targeting populations
            with low health literacy. With more and more people turning towards television, internet platforms and
            social media for information consumption, health professionals and experts can focus on providing relevant,
            accurate information. Furthermore, online repositories can encourage eHealth literacy. This curation of
            trustworthy sources can aid  to improve people’s capabilities to evaluate the quality and credibility of
            health information and their sources, leading to better health lifestyles and addressing healthcare
            disparities.
        </p>
        <p>
            Trust, an essential when it comes to information and sources of information, is a concept Apurva.ai is
            grounded in. It is one of Apurva’s core values. Building a platform of collective wisdom will be more
            relevant and effective with trusted sources of information, where the ecosystem can readily lean on these
            layers of knowledge curated. 

        </p>
        <p>
            How important is trust and credibility of information important to you?
