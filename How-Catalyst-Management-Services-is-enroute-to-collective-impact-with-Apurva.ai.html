            <p class="build"> Renewed visions for the time ahead of breaking barriers and collective wisdom
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>It is always intriguing to see how Apurva is able to bring together organisations and domains to solve
            societal problems through the lens of collective wisdom. Here is the story of Catalyst Management Services
            (CMS), their journey with Apurva so far and their renewed visions for the future, stitched together from
            conversations with<strong> Raghunathan Narayanan, Co-Founder and Director, and Prerak Shah, Senior
                Associate</strong>. </p>

        <p>
            Catalyst Management Services (CMS) works on improving the health and well-being of each individual,
            especially the vulnerable communities. Aiming to improve 100 million lives of vulnerable populations, they
            share their thoughts on how Apurva.ai as an impact tool boosts their pace and efficiency to reach their
            goal.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong> Collectivised Wisdom<br></strong>
            Prerak Shah, Senior Associate at CMS, describes how Apurva.ai emphasised the importance of collectivising
            knowledge and wisdom from multiple sources. This led to a shift in focus on how CMS is able to democratise
            wisdom curated instead of retaining it, thereby reaching and working with larger communities, and eventually
            benefitting the larger ecosystem. “When we started using Apurva for a few of the interactions, we were able
            to synthesise in a much more streamlined and structured manner, and we didn't have to spend a lot of time
            synthesising this information as well, because it used to be more accessible and easily consumable.”
            Knowledge derived with the help of Apurva ranges from calls to actions, different themes emerging from
            conversations, and new insights from the field, which eventually get institutionalised within the
            organisation. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Raghunathan Narayanan, Co-Founder and Director, further adds that collective wisdom is essential for their
            organisation as they repeatedly work on complex societal problems which are multidimensional and
            multi-layered. He goes on to emphasise the importance of collective wisdom by stating, “Every organisation
            takes a stance, has an approach on its own, and it looks at learnings from outside. Collective kind of
            wisdom is important as a particular context requires different solutions, and there's no one solution which
            is workable everywhere.” </p>
        <p>
            <strong>CMS and Apurva.ai <br></strong>
            CMS has been in awe of Apurva.ai’s<strong> Power of Co-creation</strong>, the insights emerging from
            conversations and
            Apurva’s active role in the discussions. Similar to so many who have encountered Apurva, both Narayanan’s
            and Shah’s AHA moment was during their first interaction of querying Apurva. Narayanan shares, “When we came
            back and saw the output, I was wondering what was the possibility of a tool like this. It was about picking
            up those threads and giving back those points for further discussions, resulting in deepening the
            discussion.” Narayanan was impressed with the ability to derive meaningful insights from diverse community
            voices that are available immediately, thereby improving their ability to respond with various solutions
            quickly. Shah, on the other hand, was excited how Apurva was able to pick up nuances across different
            languages and geographies and synthesise all the knowledge curated, thereby breaking barriers present today.

        </p>
        <div class="networkcard">
            <p> <strong>Power of Co-creation</strong></p>
            <p>
                Apurva.ai joins and participates in conversations, both online and offline, to co-create knowledge. The
                platform actively listens and adds to the discussion and provides perspectives, sentiments, ideas and
                call-to-actions at the end. The knowledge co-created can be queried during and post the conversations.
                The emerging collective wisdom is added to the ever-growing Apurva’s digital brain of the organisation.
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>
            Narayanan recalls querying the conversations from the women's economic empowerment program and finding new
            insights on how women entrepreneurs are stigmatised, harassed, how they have to deal with English-speaking
            customers and more. Narayanan was astounded by the insights as they are not drawn out during their routine
            reviews. Shah too highlighted how they were able to derive insights from women entrepreneurs on the
            challenges and barriers they face, despite conversations being in local languages. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Narayanan explains that Apurva fits perfectly with CMS’s goal to solve for vulnerable populations across
            different parts with context-relevant and quick responses. With Apurva, the collective wisdom emerging from
            conversational querying and institutional knowledge, from a specific theme or combination of themes and
            across languages, enhances problem-solving. “It is an impact tool, through which an organisation's
            effectiveness can be improved. This will enable us to be able to deliver our work much better.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Narayanan is specifically excited to build the agency of communities with Apurva.ai. Working across
            different domains, geographies and populations, he describes how CMS works on building responses to various
            problems faced by different populations. “Everybody brings their experiences together, their own reflections
            together around agency building, and Apurva can look at building for those specific units, and
            organisations, as a catalyst.”

        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Visions for the time ahead <br></strong>
            Narayanan states that, “Apurva can be an enabler of organisations, a tool in which new perspectives can be
            built.” He elaborates how societal issues are extremely complex and systemic, making it difficult for people
            to learn and trace patterns by just reading and listening to people’s experiences. Instead, leveraging the
            time and work invested by people to understand the system can open new routes of looking at societal issues
            and approaches to solve them. This impact tool can play a significant role in improving effectiveness for
            policymakers, program planners, nano micro and small medium enterprises.
        </p>
        <p>
            Shah envisions using Apurva with their communities and their ecosystem network to derive the pockets of
            wisdom that lies within these spaces, which leads to the crux of most of the work done by CMS. He claims
            that “The biggest value add will be at the community level because institutions can enable or push for it,
            but it is not necessarily valued at the community level. So once we understand and showcase the value of it
            to communities, it can be translated to the community institutions, then to the organisation and there'll be
            more buying for the entire chain of people who are working for the community.” With the collective wisdom
            curated, Shah says they want to understand challenges at the community institutional level by going beyond
            implementation and also looking into design, network and methods to scale their solutions. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Shah probes the relevance of Apurva with the question, “How do we bring different context-based knowledge to
            other places? Maybe not 100% fit, but at least 80%, which will lead to a decrease in discovery cost.” He
            further adds that this can be possible. “This can be enabled by Apurva if all the ecosystem players start
            using it and understand the value that each of them bring to the ecosystem. This can be translated to
            different geographies and different communities as well.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Narayanan describes the journey of Apurva and CMS as a “highly co-creation process” where it is “helping
            others to learn and grow exponentially. To me, I think CMS and Apurva are in the pathway for collective
            impact.”
