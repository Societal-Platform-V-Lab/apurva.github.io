            </p>

        </div>

        <p>The first time I heard the phrase ‘Emergence of Collective Wisdom with Apurva.ai’, I visualised it as a
            multi-way bridge. The bridge connects diverse individuals of different backgrounds and regions. It fills up
            gaps and breaks barriers of access. It offers multiple routes of perspectives that are continuously
            exchanged and they meet in between, indicating the convergence of these perspectives. Its strong foundation
            lies in people’s experience, insights and expertise. It is better sustained by larger groups of individuals
            as supportive pillars. This is how I visualise the emergence of collective wisdom with Apurva.ai, where it
            allows inclusive and holistic approaches to decision making and problem solving. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The term collective wisdom has had a long journey and has been perceived differently over the years. Our
            understanding of the term is based on these perspectives. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Collective wisdom can be traced all the way back to <strong>Aristotle</strong> and his quote “Many heads are
            better than one”
            where the great thinker highlights the significance of wisdom unfolding from multiple perspectives, even a
            group of laypeople, over a single expert  <sup>3</sup> . 
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Francis</strong> Galton observed in a fair how the median and mean of laypeople’s guesses on the
            weight of an ox came
            closer to the actual weight. Galton concludes that the collective judgement is generally smarter than any
            individual judgement <sup>2</sup> .
        </p>
        <p>
            This is further elaborated by <strong>James Surowiecki</strong> in his book titled ‘The Wisdom of Crowds:
            Why the Many Are
            Smarter Than the Few and How Collective Wisdom Shapes Business, Economies, Societies and Nations’ (2004).
            Surowiecki claims that collective wisdom is a result of millions of people contributing their insights and
            experiences where direct deliberation isn't part of the process <sup>1</sup> .
        </p>

        <p>
            Surowiecki emphasises on four concepts for the emergence of collective wisdom1.<br>
            (i) <strong>diversity</strong>  in rationality of individuals<br>
            (ii) <strong>independent</strong>  thinking of individuals<br>
            (iii) <strong>decentralised</strong>  systems across levels to include individuals and local groups closer to the ground to
            provide problem-specific knowledge<br>
            (iv) <strong>aggregation</strong>  of locally acquired knowledge across the world<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the years, the definition and features of attributing collective wisdom has been shaped by various
            thinkers and scholars. The scholars have emphasised that collective wisdom emerging is more intelligent with
            bigger groups as they have reduced influence on each other, more prone to discuss conflicts openly and
            average of error diminishes with more number of insights. Groups are more intelligent if there are high
            levels of trust and low levels of hierarchy structures <sup>2 & 4. </sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            At Apurva.ai, we define collective wisdom as the collaboration of individuals or groups from different
            segments of society to solve a complex systems problem. Each group brings their unique perspectives,
            experiences and expertise towards the problem. When these diverse perspectives are combined, we gain a
            comprehensive understanding of the broader system that cannot be achieved alone. It signifies the collective
            understanding and decision-making capacity of the entire group. The compounding effect of blocks of
            intelligence leads to the emergence of collective wisdom.

            As Helen Keller once said, "Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much." So, how do you perceive
            collective wisdom?
