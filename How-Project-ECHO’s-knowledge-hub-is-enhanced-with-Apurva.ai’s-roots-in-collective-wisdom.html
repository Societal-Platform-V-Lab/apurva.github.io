            <p class="build"> A journey of accessible, inclusive and democratised knowledge
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>A platform for knowledge generation and sharing, Project ECHO is on a steady trajectory to not only touch,
            but enhance a billion lives. Here is their story of how they are working faster and more efficiently towards
            their goal with Apurva.ai’s focus on collective wisdom. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Project ECHO is a non-profit movement working on multiple SDGs, with heightened focus in healthcare. With a
            focused mission of providing the right knowledge at the right place at the right time, they have grounded
            their expertise as a credible and accessible knowledge hub. They aim to empower communities across the
            globe, even in the remotest areas, with the right knowledge, enabling problem solving in the communities as
            well as at scale. This is implemented through the creation of a trusted human network, an accessible and
            inclusive space for knowledge sharing.

        </p>
        <p>
            Over a detailed conversation with<strong> Kartik Dhar, Chief Technology Officer at Project ECHO, the bigger
                goals of
                Project ECHO</strong>, role of Apurva and the transformative journey undertaken so far were explored.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong> ECHO AND APURVA.AI<br></strong>
            Dhar explained how Project ECHO and Apurva.ai complement each other. “The combination of a trusted human
            network and AI amplifies the exponential impact to the communities. Our strength of creating human networks
            and enhancing their capabilities is expanded by the additional layer of Apurva.” The combination makes
            knowledge easily accessible and scalable to communities. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Looking back to Dhar’s first interaction with Apurva, Dhar describes his experience. “We were having a live
            discussion about Apurva and about our iECHO platform, and just seeing it in real time, able to digest our
            conversations and make sense out of it and present it in a very crisp manner, and then have that knowledge
            base sort of queryable afterwards. It was really an AHA moment, the first time that I saw Apurva.”

        </p>
        <p>
            Project ECHO, through their iECHO platform, paves the way for knowledge generation with multiple
            contributors. iECHO platform is a digital infrastructure where third party systems can access and share data
            with trusted providers, and forms a strong foundation as a knowledge hub. This platform, already an active
            knowledge hub, was enhanced by Apurva.ai’s <strong> Power of Co-creation</strong>.
        </p>
        <div class="networkcard">
            <p> <strong>Power of Co-creation</strong></p>
            <p>
                Power of Co-creation
                Apurva.ai joins and participates in conversations, both online and offline, to co-create knowledge. The
                platform actively listens and adds to the discussion and provides perspectives, sentiments, ideas and
                call-to-actions at the end. The knowledge co-created can be queried during and post the conversations.
                The emerging collective wisdom is added to the ever-growing Apurva’s digital brain of the organisation.

                    <p>Dhar was very excited about both the synchronous and asynchronous aspect of insights provided by
                        Apurva during the sessions and the ability to go back and query the system for answers. He
                        states that these sessions of co-creation have added a lot of value. “Many of our
                        partners have been able to distil the learnings, as well as get summarization of very varied and
                        very rich discussion, as it is difficult to get to the crux of and do it in an easy manner.”

                            He further elaborates that the multifaceted approach of both short, synthesised crisp
                            summaries
                            and longer,
                            data enriched insights offered different ways to consume the knowledge generated. Though
                            there
                            were some
                            setbacks in accuracy of terminologies, which is critical to amplify accurate information in
                            healthcare, the
                            potential of how Apurva is a game changer was not lost. Dhar is hopeful that with more data
                            and
                            human
                            feedback, the accuracy will improve. </span>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Synchronous aspect</strong> is when Apurva actively participates in conversations and
                        offers relevant
                        insights, questions and directions in real time. Whereas the
                        <br>
                        <strong> Asynchronous aspect </strong>is when Apurva provides insights in different modes of
                        text, audios and
                        videos to queries from previously curated knowledge.

            feedback, the accuracy will improve. 
        </p>

        <p>
            He goes on to say that, “Apurva is able to take a holistic view of things and synthesise data from multiple
            sources. It has its own insight as well, and it's able to add them to the data.” He further points out that
            Apurva stays true to the source, adds its own colours in the form of insights and does it in a balanced way.
            The circle of credibility and trust in knowledge generated, the core of Project ECHO, retained with Apurva. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong> ACCESS, INCLUDE AND DEMOCRATISE <br></strong>
            With the aim to democratise knowledge, access and inclusion has always been the bedrock of Project ECHO.
            This is further enhanced by Apurva where silos of communications, restrictions on sharing knowledge and
            barriers of languages are broken down. Dhar claims that the majority of their discussions are in English,
            traditionally a big bottleneck. “Now, the ​participant ​can ​have ​access ​to and ​learn ​resources ​outside
            ​their ​language ​as ​well.”

        </p>
        <p>
            It was interesting to note the subtle shift of Project ECHO’s aim to empower individual participants with
            the right knowledge and create a trusted human network to focus on collective wisdom curated from the
            network and harness this at a large scale. Dhar claims this shift was a result of Apurva.ai’s emphasis on
            collective wisdom. 

        </p>
        <p>
            Working on a hub and spoke model, Dhar states the Project ECHO is moving towards bringing these hubs and
            spokes closer to each other. Apurva's ever growing digital brain, curating the collective wisdom emerging
            across the world, enhances Project ECHO’s position as a knowledge hub with beyond the box insights on
            connections and intersections. “In the long term, our view is that the asynchronous component of Apurva
            would basically be a game changer as far as the community building aspect is concerned. And this is a big
            focus for us at Echo, in the long run, in creating a trusted human network.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Our thinking has historically always been around communities of practice and building human connection. And
            it will continue to do so. That is the core of what Echo does. But this combination of human plus AI is
            something which can propel us on our mission to touch 1 billion lives much faster and much more
            efficiently.”
